The upper gastrointestinal endoscopy performed urgently 6 hours after admission shows a normal stomach, without blood or hematic debris and an excavated ulcer of 8 mm in diameter in the anterior face of the duodenal bulb with \"visible vessel\" at its base and without active bleeding. Which of the following statements is true?\n1.- In the initial endoscopy it is indicated to apply an endoscopic therapy and subsequently to establish endovenous treatment with high doses of a proton pump inhibitor. This strategy has been shown to reduce the risk of hemorrhagic recurrence and mortality.\n2.- In the initial endoscopy, given the absence of active bleeding, endoscopic therapy is not indicated. Subsequently, to reduce the risk of hemorrhagic recurrence, intravenous treatment with high doses of a proton pump inhibitor should be started.\n3.- n initial endoscopy, endoscopic therapy is indicated. Subsequent treatment with high doses of a proton pump inhibitor has not been shown to be of any additional benefit.\n4.- Since this is a complicated ulcer (hemorrhage) the best therapeutic option, once the hemorrhagic episode is resolved, is a vagotomy and pyloroplasty.\n5.- None",

Her father (not diagnosed with NF1) died in a traffic accident at the age of 38 years. On examination, the mother presents two cafÃ©-au-lait spots and attends the genetic counseling consultation with her new partner where a preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is proposed. Is PGD indicated in this case?\n1.- Yes, as the mother has 2 cafÃ©-au-lait spots, she is a carrier and PGD is indicated with these data.\n2.- It is indicated after detection of the causative mutation in the index case and eventually in his mother.\n3.- It is not indicated because NF1 responds to mutations in the neurofibromin gene (17q11.2), with recessive inheritance.\n4.- No, two cafÃ©-au-lait spots are not diagnostic and your new partner is very unlikely to be a carrier (NF1 is a rare disease).\n5.- With these data, PGD is indicated, consisting of selecting embryos in vitro, to implant in the maternal uterus those without the mutation.",
