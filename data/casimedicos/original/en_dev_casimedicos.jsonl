{"id": 159, "year": 2012, "question_id_specific": 111, "full_question": "A 45-year-old male patient with a history of uric lithiasis with repeated expulsive nephritic colic for 25 years, comes to the ED referring palpitations and intense right lumbar pain since 2 hours before. Urinalysis showed a pH of 5.5 and leukocyturia without proteinuria. The ECG confirms a previously unknown atrial fibrillation. Blood biochemistry shows a creatinine of 0.9mg/dl, a calcium of 11mg/dl and an LDH of 950 U/l. What is the most useful diagnostic maneuver to perform?", "full_answer": "In this question I have more doubts as to which is the correct answer, since we must interpret which is the most useful test, with which we can obtain more performance. However, this situation also depends on the radiology services of each center and their preferences. I will focus on the urological part, leaving aside the rest of the symptomatology. - Abdominal X-ray is the first imaging study to be performed because it is fast, simple and practically innocuous (except in children and pregnant women). 90% of the stones are radiopaque and therefore visible, but the sensitivity of this test, used in isolation, decreases to 45-59%. It is a mandatory test in any suspicion of colic pain. However, it has a lower yield than the others. Although the urological history speaks of uric lithiasis (radiotransparent), with an acid pH that reaffirms the diagnosis of uric origin, we can never rule out calcium oxalate lithiasis that can appear synchronously. - IVUS seems to me to be one of the best performing options. It will give us diagnostic clarity of obstruction, its magnitude and its renal repercussions. It has long been considered the examination of choice for the study of patients with renal lithiasis. It is a test with high sensitivity and specificity (87-90% and 94-100%, respectively), relatively innocuous, and available in all hospitals. It informs us of the number, size, shape and location of the stone, as well as the functional status of the affected kidney. - Contrast-enhanced CT seems to me to be the most efficient option. It serves to discover lithiasis that other tests cannot find and gives us a global image of the rest of the structures. Great performance but also more expensive, more time, more radiation. It has been confirmed as a high sensitivity and specificity scan, surpassing previous tests (94-100% and 92-100%, respectively, for the detection of ureteral calculi) and with its numerous advantages it has become the reference test and is expected to replace IVUS and ultrasound worldwide. It performs a helical scan with 5 mm slices allowing the detection of stones up to 2 mm. With the administration of contrast, it allows the evaluation of renal function. - Ultrasound is a fast, cheap and innocuous test, but very radiologist-dependent. It gives great renal information on obstructive repercussions, but less quality in terms of finding a lithiasis. Ultrasonography only detects calculi larger than 4 mm, located in the pyelo-ureteral junction or the uretero-vesical junction, while the lumbar and pelvic ureter is not very accessible due to the interposition of the intestinal loops. Therefore, ultrasound performed in isolation is not very sensitive (20-45%) for the detection of calculi, but associated with simple abdominal radiography increases its sensitivity and specificity. - Doppler echocardiography has no use in urological diagnosis. My answer would be CT with ev contrast and excretory phase (answer (c)), in terms of performance, sensitivity and specificity. There are radiology services more skilled or predisposed to one or the other.

It had started as an erythematous lesion on his left thumb. He had visible reddish striae as connecting lines between the lesions. The patient had no fever or other general symptoms. He had been working in his garden but did not remember any injuries. The etiologic diagnosis was made by culture of a skin biopsy.

The symptoms are chronic, which started distally (left thumb) and are affecting the ipsilateral arm (reddish striae). There were no systemic symptoms.

Of the microorganisms discussed, Microsporum gypseum does not usually manifest dissemination of infection of a lymphangitic aspect, in general keratinophilic fungi (dermatophytes) do not have any ability to invade deep tissues, so we ruled out this option. Staphylococcus aureus infection can affect superficial and deep tissue layers, they can spread following a lymphangitic path, but it is not usual such a long evolution, it is usually acute (days) and usually accompanied by systemic symptoms, so we discard this option. Mycobacterium marinum (and not Mycobacterum marinum) is a non-tuberculous mycobacterium characterized by being environmental, opportunistic and photochromogenic. It has a slow growth, from 2 to 8 weeks, at a temperature ranging from 30 to 37 °C.

The statement focuses exclusively on this part of the examination and also explains that it is indeed positive, which leads to the suspicion of a meniscal lesion. \"The Thessaly test is a dynamic reproduction of load transmission in the knee joint and is performed at 5° and 20° of flexion. The examiner supports the patient by holding his or her outstretched hands while the patient stands flatfooted on the floor. The patient then rotates his or her knee and body, internally and externally, three times, keeping the knee in slight flexion (5°). Then the same procedure is carried out with the knee flexed at 20°. Patients with suspected meniscal tears experience medial or lateral joint-line discomfort and may have a sense of locking or catching. The theory behind the test is that, with this maneuver, the knee with a meniscal tear is subjected to excessive loading conditions and almost certainly will have the same symptoms that the patient reported. The test is always performed first on the normal knee so that the patient may be trained, especially with regard to how to keep the knee in 5° and then in 20° of flexion and how to recognize, by comparison, a possible positive result in the symptomatic knee.\" Answer 2 incorrect: At no time do they describe any exploration maneuvers of the anterior cruciate ligament, nor do they mention any trauma that may have injured it.
