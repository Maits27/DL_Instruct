His history includes glipizide, atenolol and acenocoumarol. She has been to the ER 3 times in the last three months for \"dizziness\", low back pain and an INR of 5. She reports independence in basic and instrumental activities of daily living. There is no evidence of family or close friends. Several references from the social work in the area indicate that she refuses medical or nursing aids or visits. In the physical examination, only temperature of 37.7, BMI of 16, BP of 160/90, HR of 90 and SO2 of 99% stand out. He has global loss of muscle mass. He is dressed in his robe and smells of urine. He refuses to answer Minimental's questions.
